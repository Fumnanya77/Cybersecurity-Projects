# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Labs & Walkthroughs

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Labs Repository**, where I share my hands-on exercises, walkthroughs, and code snippets from cybersecurity labs, challenges, and CTF platforms like [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com), and more.

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base and a resource for others learning ethical hacking, penetration testing, and blue team operations.

## ⚙️ Tools & Scripts

You’ll find useful automation scripts, payloads, one-liners, and configurations that I’ve either written or modified during labs. These scripts are categorized per challenge and reusable for future scenarios.

## 📝 Notes & References

Each walkthrough includes:
- Summary of the target environment
- Step-by-step methodology
- Tools and commands used
- Lessons learned
- Screenshots (when applicable)

I try to maintain OSCP-style methodology throughout the labs.
